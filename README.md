## üèÜ Overview

Susanoo(Janus) is a groundbreaking Uniswap V4 hook that implements fully private limit orders using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This revolutionary approach allows traders to place take-profit and stop-loss orders without revealing their strategies to the network, solving one of DeFi's most persistent problems: MEV exploitation through strategy visibility.

**Problem Solved**: Traditional limit orders on chain would need their prices and logic directly on chain hereby reducing trade alpha and exposing degen traders to MEV.

**Key Innovation**: First implementation of encrypted conditional trading logic that executes only when hidden conditions are met, without ever exposing those conditions to the public blockchain.



## üîê Partner Integration

### Fhenix Network

**Core Technology Provider**: Susanoo is built on Fhenix's FHE co-processor technology, enabling:

- Encrypted trigger price storage (`euint32 triggerTick`)
- Private order type specification (`ebool orderType`)
- Homomorphic computation of trading conditions
- Asynchronous threshold decryption of execution signals

#### Integration Points

| Component | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `FHE.sol` library | All encrypted operations | Core encryption primitives |
| Threshold decryption network | Order execution validation | Fhenix co-processor |
| Encrypted state management | Hook lifecycle persistence | On-chain encrypted storage |
| `cofhe.js` integration | Client-side encryption | Frontend order creation |

## üéØ Problem Being Solved

Traditional limit orders on AMMs suffer from transparency-induced MEV:

- ‚ùå Front-running of stop-loss and take-profit orders
- ‚ùå Strategy extraction from visible order books
- ‚ùå Price manipulation around known liquidity points
- ‚ùå Information asymmetry favoring sophisticated bots

Susanoo solves this by keeping all critical order parameters encrypted until execution:

- ‚úÖ Encrypted trigger prices
- ‚úÖ Hidden order types (stop-loss/take-profit)
- ‚úÖ Private execution logic
- ‚úÖ Visible only to the order placer

## ‚ú® How It Works

### Architecture Overview

```mermaid

    A[User Places Order] --> B[Encrypt trigger price & type with cofhe.js]
    B --> C[Store Encrypted Order on-chain]
    C --> D[Pool Swap Occurs]
    D --> E[afterSwap: Request FHE Condition Check]
    E --> F[Fhenix Network: Homomorphic Evaluation]
    F --> G[beforeSwap: Process Decryption Queue]
    G --> H{Condition Met?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Execute Order]
    H -->|No| J[Leave in Queue]
```

### Technical Implementation

#### Encrypted Order Structure

```solidity
struct Order {
    address trader;
    bool zeroForOne;
    OrderStatus status;
    ebool orderType;     // Encrypted: true = TakeProfit, false = StopLoss
    euint32 triggerTick; // Encrypted trigger price
    uint256 amount;
    PoolId keyId;
}
```

#### FHE-Powered Execution Flow

1. **Order Placement**: User encrypts trigger parameters off-chain using Fhenix's `cofhe.js`
2. **Condition Monitoring**: Pool swaps trigger homomorphic evaluation of encrypted conditions
3. **Threshold Decryption**: Fhenix network computes whether to execute without revealing why
4. **Atomic Execution**: Verified orders execute in next swap with full slippage protection

## üöÄ Unique Value Proposition

### Originality

- First FHE-based limit order hook in Uniswap ecosystem
- Novel encrypted condition paradigm - conditions remain hidden even during evaluation
- Zero-strategy-leakage design - completely new approach to AMM order types

### Unique Execution 

- Dual-phase decryption system: Condition checking ‚Üí Amount execution
- Tick offset encryption scheme: Adapts FHE to Uniswap V3/V4 tick system
- Asynchronous yet atomic execution: Maintains Uniswap safety guarantees
- Gas-optimized queue processing: Efficient FHE operation batching

### Impact

- Democratizes trading strategies: Retail traders protected from MEV and trade alpha is preserved.
- Enables institutional DeFi: Large orders without signaling risk
- Protects liquidity providers: Prevents predatory trading around known liquidity
- Advances privacy-preserving DeFi: Sets new standard for on-chain privacy

## üîß Technical Deep Dive

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Homomorphic Condition Evaluation

```solidity
function _calculateExecutionCondition(Order memory order, int24 currentTick, bool priceIncreased)
    private
    returns (euint128)
{
    // All operations occur on encrypted data
    ebool takeProfitCondition = FHE.and(priceIncreasedEnc, FHE.gte(currentTickEnc, triggerTick));
    ebool stopLossCondition = FHE.and(FHE.not(priceIncreasedEnc), FHE.lte(currentTickEnc, triggerTick));
    return FHE.asEuint128(FHE.select(orderType, takeProfitCondition, stopLossCondition));
}
```

#### 2. Asynchronous Execution Pipeline

| Phase | Hook | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Condition Check | `afterSwap` | Request FHE network evaluation |
| Result Processing | `beforeSwap` | Process decrypted results |
| Safety | Both | Atomic revert protection maintains safety |

#### 3. Tick Encryption Scheme

- Transforms negative ticks to unsigned range for FHE compatibility
- Maintains full Uniswap V3/V4 price precision
- Zero precision loss in encryption/decryption process

## üìä Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| Gas Overhead per Order | ~15-20% | Mainly FHE operations |
| Decryption Time | 1-2 blocks | Fhenix network latency |
| Maximum Orders per Swap | Limited by gas | Queue processing efficiency |
| Privacy Level | Complete | Zero strategy leakage |

## üõ† Installation & Usage

   Pool initialized
   Liquidity added

   Susanoo ecosystem deployed successfully!

   Update Config.sol with these addresses:
   PoolManager poolManager = IPoolManager(0x84eA74d481Ee0A5332c457a4d796187F6Ba67fEB);
   IHooks hookContract = IHooks(0x303C5560eb3229fe2b73f920513aDAAaba1a90c0);

   ```

3. **Save Configuration**

   Update your `script/base/Config.sol` file with the deployed addresses for future testnet interactions.

### Verification

After deployment, verify your contracts are working by:

1. Checking the deployed hook contract has the correct permissions
2. Placing a test order to ensure the encryption and queue system works
3. Performing a swap to trigger order evaluation

## üñ• Frontend Setup
