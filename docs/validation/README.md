# Problem & Solution Validation

This section presents Susanoo's Problem and Solution Validation Worksheet — a structured research artifact that documents why Susanoo exists, who it serves, and how it compares to existing solutions.

{% hint style="info" %}
This worksheet follows a four-part validation framework: hypothesis, market research, target analysis, and thesis lock-in.
{% endhint %}

## Summary

Publicly visible trade intent and limit-order information on mempools and order books create a predictable attack surface that MEV searchers and adversarial counterparties exploit — producing **hundreds of millions in extracted value** and millions of dollars worth of daily sandwich and front-run events.

**Susanoo** gives DEXes and wallets a cryptographic privacy layer for limit orders using FHE. It prevents mempool and orderbook intent leakage without re-routing flows or introducing centralized relays — protecting users from front-running, sniping, and liquidation hunting.
